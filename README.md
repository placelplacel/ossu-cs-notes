# ossu-notes
> **NOTE:** These notes are specifically tailored for me! Others might find these notes helpful but this is not intended to serve as a reference covering everything; only things that I am more prone to forget about.

A repository housing my notes and code as I progress through the [OSSU CS curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). This repository has been made public for two reasons:
1. Easier cloning
2. As an exhibit displaying my progress thus far

## Numbering Convention
**For top-level/course directories:** Two digit number with the first digit representing the subject and the second digit representing the course.

**For files within the course directories:** Two digit number with the first digit representing the topic and the second digit representing the order/serial number.
