# ossu-notes
> **NOTE:** These notes are specifically tailored for me! Others might find these notes helpful but this is not intended to serve as a reference covering everything; only things that I am more prone to forget about.

A repository housing my notes and code as I progress through the OSSU curriculum. This repository has been made public for two reasons:
1. Easier cloning
2. As an exhibit displaying my progress thus far
